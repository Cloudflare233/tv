Periodic function: If the function f(x) satisfies f(x)=f(x+T) (or: f(x+a)=f(x-b), (a+b=T)

Important Corollary to Periodic Functions

"If the function f(x) (x∈D) has two symmetry axes x=a, x=b in the domain of definition, then the function f(x) is a periodic function, and the period T=2|b-a| (not necessarily the smallest positive cycle)."

"If the function f(x) (x∈D) has two symmetry centers A(a, 0), B(b, 0) in the domain of definition, then the function f(x) is a periodic function, and the period T=2|b-a | (Not necessarily the smallest positive period)."

"If the function f(x) (x∈D) has an axis of symmetry x=a and a center of symmetry B(b, 0) (a≠b) in the domain of definition, then the function f(x) is a periodic function, and the period T=4|b-a| (not necessarily the smallest positive period)."
