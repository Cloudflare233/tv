[National New College Entrance Examination II 2021·8, 5 points] It is known that the definition domain of the function f(x) is R, and f(x+2) is an even function,
f(2x+1) is an odd function, then the value of the following options must be 0 ( )
A.f(-1/2) B.f(-1) C.f(2) D.f(4)

Answer: B

Analysis: From the meaning of the question: f(x+2) is an even function ⟹f(x) The image is symmetrical about the line x=2
(The reason is that f(x+2) is symmetric about the y-axis and is obtained by shifting f(x) to the left by two unit lengths.),
Therefore, it can be deduced that f(2x) is symmetric about the point (1/2,0) by f(2x+1) being an odd function.
(The reason is that f(2x)=f(2(x-1/2)+1), that is, f(2x) is obtained by shifting f(2x+1) to the right by 0.5 units).
So (0, 0) moves right to (0.5, 0)). In fact, it is now known that the center of symmetry of f(x) is (1, 0) (obtained by multiplying the abscissa of f(2x)). Known from the nature of the periodic function: T=4|2-1|=4. So f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4. Obviously f(1)=0 and f(3)=0 from the symmetry of f(x) about x=2, and f(-1+4)=f(-1)=0 from the periodic function property. So choose B.

For solving such types of problems, the combination of numbers and shapes is a good idea.
