Since I created [music.cf233.ga](https://music.cf233.ga). This site has been used as my personal music player. Just as you can imagine, how hard it is to add a simple song to it. But in fact, it is very simple and useful. It can be done in just few seconds.

## Step 1

For the first step, we need to open the [NetEase Cloud Music](https://music.163.com) and get the songs' IDs. If you don't know what the ID is. No problem, just copy the URL so that you can copy the number after "id=". This is what we need. We need to copy it and paste it in the next step.

> Notice: Because of the security problem, we can only copy one ID one time.

## Step 2

Then, we can open the project. It dues to where you put it on. Just open `index.js` and find the line `const data= [...]`. Just add your code like this:

```
const data = [
    {
        title: "",
        id: ":,
    },
    {
        title: "",
        id: "",
    },
]

```

> Notice: Don't forget the "," after the "}"

## Step 3

All right! You made it. And what you should do is deploy your own to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Have fun!
